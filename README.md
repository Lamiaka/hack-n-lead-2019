The challange chosen by the team is the one proposed by Credit Suisse (https://share.nuclino.com/p/HacknLead-2019-Challenges-6o0DigwQEVIL2ZSXrBcY_x). Data used was provided by Credit Suisse and some additional sources from internet (https://github.com/emusto/hack-n-lead-2019-team1/tree/master/Data). We built a predictive model running on Jupyter notebook.

### Motivation
Nowadays, today is 70% of credit fraud/money laundring commited internally. However, with new technologies this attacks are starting to transfer to external enviroment. Therefore it is needed to develop automated techniques to detect suspicious activity in order to take load of data analysts shoudlers.

### Machine Learning Model
In this problem we use Machine Learning techniques. In JupyterNotebook you can found really simply model for purpose of demonstration. We use random forest on provided dataset who helps us detect suspicious acitivities. More models need to be explore, another source of data.
